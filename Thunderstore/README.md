# Alchemy Machine Recipes
This is a PotionCraft mod to allow the saving of alchemy machine recipes! This mod is compatible with Potion Craft v1.1!

It enables the save recipe button when finishing a substance in the alchemy machine:

When a recipe is saved it works just like a regular recipe but requires the ingredients of each potion used to make it. The recipe does not require the actual potions used previously so you can even delete your previously saved potion recipes once you save a recipe for the legendary item itself:

## Other Mods
I am making a series of mods which make recipes easier to use. All of these mods are intended to be balanced and feel like part of the base game:

[Recipe Waypoints](https://potion-craft.thunderstore.io/package/AndrewFahlgren/Recipe_Waypoints/) - Allows you to see where your waypoint recipes (those with no effects or are far away from their last effect) are on the map so you know where you are going when you continue brewing from that recipe.

[Pour Back In](https://potion-craft.thunderstore.io/package/AndrewFahlgren/Pour_Back_In/) - Makes your potions work just like recipes. Pour potions back in the cauldron to continue where you left off. You can also finish potions before you add any effects so you can come back to them later just like a waypoint recipe.
