# Alchemy Machine Recipes

**This mod is now obsolete! Potion Craft 2.0 has added a much better system for saving legendary recipes and totally reworked the needed potion effects! This mod can be uninstalled and your recipe pages used for legendary recipes will be blank. There will be no conversion of modded recipes so you will need to remake them.**



## Other Mods

I am making a series of mods which make recipes easier to use. All of these mods are intended to be balanced and feel like part of the base game:

[Bookmark Organizer](https://github.com/AndrewFahlgren/PotionCraftBookmarkOrganizer) - Lets you organize your recipes into groups! Save space in your recipe book and find the recipe you are looking for faster!

[Recipe Waypoints](https://github.com/AndrewFahlgren/PotionCraftRecipeWaypoints) - Allows you to see where your waypoint recipes (those with no effects or are far away from their last effect) are on the map so you know where you are going when you continue brewing from that recipe.

[Pour Back In](https://github.com/AndrewFahlgren/PotionCraftPourBackIn) - Makes your potions work just like recipes. Pour potions back in the cauldron to continue where you left off. You can also finish potions before you add any effects so you can come back to them later just like a waypoint recipe.

[Brew From Here](https://github.com/AndrewFahlgren/PotionCraftUsefulRecipeMarks) - Lets you continue brewing from any recipe mark.
