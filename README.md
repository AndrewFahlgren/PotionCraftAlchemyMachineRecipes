# Alchemy Machine Recipes
This is a PotionCraft mod to allow the saving of alchemy machine recipes!

It enables the save recipe button when finishing a substance in the alchemy machine:

When a recipe is saved it works just like a regular recipe but requires the ingredients of each potion used to make it. The recipe does not require the actual potions used previously so you can even delete your previously saved potion recipes once you save a recipe for the legendary item itself:
